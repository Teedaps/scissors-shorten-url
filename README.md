Shorten URL is a simple and efficient tool designed to transform long and cumbersome web addresses into shorter and more manageable URLs. This project aims to simplify the sharing and communication of web links, making them easier to remember, share, and incorporate into various platforms.
URL shortening works by taking a long URL as input and generating a shorter, more concise version. When a user accesses the shortened URL, they are redirected to the original, longer URL.
Shortening URLs: Convert lengthy web addresses into concise, shortened URLs for easy sharing and distribution.
Customization: Optionally, users can customize the generated shortened URLs with relevant keywords or tags for better recognition and personalization.
Analytics: Track the usage and engagement of the shortened URLs with built-in analytics. Gain insights into the number of clicks, geographic location, and referring sources.
